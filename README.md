# Pneumonia_Prediction

The model I built using this data set can distinguish between Healthy and Pneumonic lungs.
The dataset used includes human lungs, and it contains both healthy and pneumonic lungs.
This data set was selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients aged one to five years from the Women's and Children's Medical Center.
