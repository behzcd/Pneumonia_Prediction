# Pneumonia_Prediction

- The Model I built can distinguish between Healthy and Pneumonic lungs.

- The dataset used includes human lungs, and it contains both healthy and pneumonic lungs.
This data set was selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients aged one to five years from the Women's and Children's Medical Center.



- Why did I choose this problem? --- Pneumonia accounts for more than 15% of deaths in children under 5 years of age internationally. In 2015, 920,000 children under the age of 5 died from this disease. In the United States, pneumonia accounted for more than 500,000 emergency department visits per year and more than 50,000 deaths in 2015, making it one of the top 10 causes of death in the country. Although pneumonia is common, it is very difficult to make an accurate diagnosis. This requires review of the chest radiograph (CXR) by highly trained specialists and confirmation by clinical history, vital signs, and laboratory tests. Pneumonia usually appears as a hazy area or haziness on CXR. However, the diagnosis of pneumonia on CXR is complicated by a number of other conditions, such as fluid overload in the lungs (pulmonary edema), hemorrhage, volume loss (atelectasia or collapse), lung cancer, or changes following radiation or surgery. . Fluid in the pleural space outside the lungs (pleural effusion) also appears as an increase in opacity on CXR. When available, comparison of the patient's CXRs obtained at different time points and correlation with clinical symptoms and history may aid in the diagnosis.
